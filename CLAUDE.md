## Project Overview

**Project:** Phase II - Todo Full-Stack Web Application (Basic Level Functionality)

**Objective:** Transform the console app into a modern multi-user web application with persistent storage using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus.

**Development Approach:** Spec-driven development flow:
1. Write spec (`/sp.specify`)
2. Generate plan (`/sp.plan`)
3. Break into tasks (`/sp.tasks`)
4. Implement via Claude Code (`/sp.implement`)

> **IMPORTANT:** No manual coding allowed. All implementation must go through the spec-driven workflow.

### Requirements

- Implement all 5 Basic Level features as a web application
- Create RESTful API endpoints
- Build responsive frontend interface
- Store data in Neon Serverless PostgreSQL database
- Implement user authentication using Better Auth with JWT tokens

```

### Flow Steps

1. **User Login:** User submits credentials on Frontend
2. **Token Issued:** Better Auth validates credentials and issues JWT
3. **Authenticated Request:** Frontend includes JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. **Token Verification:** Backend extracts and verifies JWT
5. **User Identification:** Backend identifies user from token claims
6. **Filtered Query:** Backend queries database with user_id filter
7. **Data Retrieved:** Database returns only that user's data
8. **Response Sent:** Backend returns filtered data to Frontend

> **IMPORTANT:** All authentication logic MUST invoke the Auth Agent via the `auth-security` skill.

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General → `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‑create ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3–7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‑native flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General → `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‑MM‑DD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‑native tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution → `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General → `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‑creation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‑matter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‑part test and suggest documenting with:
  "📋 Architectural decision detected: <brief> — Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‑create the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps.

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‑goals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‑ups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‑cutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
📋 Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

# Phase III - Todo AI Chatbot

## Project Overview

**Project:** Phase III - Todo AI Chatbot (AI-Driven Development)

**Objective:** Extend the Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application with an AI-powered chatbot interface that allows users to manage tasks via natural language. Phase III integrates with the already deployed frontend (Vercel) and backend (Hugging Face). All Phase III endpoints are distinct from Phase II to ensure no disruption of existing services.

**Development Approach:** Same spec-driven development flow as Phase II:
1. Write spec (`/sp.specify`)
2. Generate plan (`/sp.plan`)
3. Break into tasks (`/sp.tasks`)
4. Implement via Claude Code (`/sp.implement`)

> **IMPORTANT:** No manual coding allowed. All implementation must go through the spec-driven workflow. Phase II endpoints and functionality must remain untouched.

### Requirements

- Add AI chatbot interface for natural language task management
- Implement stateless `/api/{user_id}/chat` endpoint (distinct from Phase II `/api/tasks`)
- Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK with MCP tools for task operations
- Persist conversation history in database (Conversation, Message tables)
- Do not modify existing Phase II Task tables or endpoints
- Deploy ChatKit frontend on Vercel; backend on Hugging Face

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | OpenAI ChatKit |
| **Backend** | FastAPI (Python) |
| **AI Framework** | OpenAI Agents SDK |
| **MCP Server** | Official MCP SDK (tools invoked via Backend Agent) |
| **ORM** | SQLModel |
| **Database** | Neon Serverless PostgreSQL |
| **Authentication** | Better Auth + JWT Tokens |

---

## Phase III Agents & Skills Reference

### Agent-to-Task Mapping

| Task Domain | Agent | Skill | Responsibilities |
|-------------|-------|-------|------------------|
| AI Chat Backend | **Backend Agent** | `fastapi-backend` | `/api/{user_id}/chat` endpoint, OpenAI Agents SDK integration, MCP tool dispatch |
| MCP Tools | **Backend Agent** | `fastapi-backend` | MCP server setup, tool definitions (add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task) |
| ChatKit Frontend | **Frontend Agent** | `frontend-nextjs` | OpenAI ChatKit integration, chat UI, conversation display |
| Database (Phase III) | **DB Agent** | `neon-db-manager` | Conversation and Message tables, migrations, conversation queries |
| Authentication | **Auth Agent** | `auth-security` | JWT validation on `/api/{user_id}/chat`, user identity from token claims |

> **NOTE:** The Backend Agent handles all MCP tool invocations directly. No separate MCP Agent is required. The MCP SDK runs in-process within the FastAPI backend.

---

## MCP Tools Specification

All MCP tools operate on the authenticated user's tasks only. Each tool is invoked by the Backend Agent via the MCP SDK when the OpenAI Agents SDK determines the user's intent.

### Tool Definitions

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters | Returns |

```

### Flow Steps

1. **User Sends Message:** ChatKit frontend sends POST to `/api/{user_id}/chat` with the user message and optional `conversation_id`.
2. **Load History:** Backend loads conversation history from database (if `conversation_id` provided).
3. **History Retrieved:** Database returns previous messages for context.
4. **Agent Invocation:** Backend sends history + new message to OpenAI Agents SDK.
5. **Tool Dispatch:** If the agent determines a task operation is needed, it invokes the appropriate MCP tool.
6. **Tool Result:** MCP tool executes against the database and returns the result.
7. **AI Response:** Agent formulates a natural language response incorporating tool results.
8. **Persist State:** Backend saves the user message and AI response to the database.
9. **Response Returned:** Backend returns the AI response and `conversation_id` to ChatKit.

### Stateless Design Principles

- **No in-memory session state:** Each request to `/api/{user_id}/chat` is independent. The backend reconstructs context by loading conversation history from the database.
- **Database as single source of truth:** All conversation state (messages, tool invocations, responses) is persisted in the Conversation and Message tables.
- **Scalability:** Stateless design allows horizontal scaling of backend instances without session affinity.
- **Safe concurrent requests:** No shared mutable state between requests; database transactions ensure consistency.

## Phase III Database Models

> **IMPORTANT:** Do not modify existing Phase II Task tables. Phase III adds new tables (Conversation, Message) and reads/writes to existing Task records via MCP tools.

### Conversation Model

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field
from typing import Optional


class Conversation(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Tracks a chat conversation session for a user."""

    id: uuid.UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4, primary_key=True)
    user_id: uuid.UUID = Field(foreign_key="user.id", index=True, nullable=False)
    title: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, max_length=255)
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)
```

### Message Model

```python
import uuid
from datetime import datetime
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field
from typing import Optional


class Message(SQLModel, table=True):
    """Stores individual messages within a conversation."""

    id: uuid.UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4, primary_key=True)
    conversation_id: uuid.UUID = Field(
        foreign_key="conversation.id", index=True, nullable=False
    )
    role: str = Field(
        nullable=False, max_length=20
    )  # "user", "assistant", or "tool"
    content: str = Field(nullable=False)
    tool_name: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, max_length=50)
    tool_args: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)  # JSON-serialized tool arguments
    tool_result: Optional[str] = Field(default=None)  # JSON-serialized tool result
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow, nullable=False)
```

### Entity Relationship

```
┌──────────┐       ┌────────────────┐       ┌───────────┐
│   User   │1─────*│  Conversation  │1─────*│  Message   │
│ (Phase II)│       │  (Phase III)   │       │ (Phase III)│
└──────────┘       └────────────────┘       └───────────┘
     │
     │1─────* (existing Phase II relationship)
     │
┌──────────┐
│   Task   │
│ (Phase II)│
└──────────┘
```

- **User → Conversation:** One user has many conversations (1:N).
- **Conversation → Message:** One conversation has many messages (1:N).
- **User → Task:** Existing Phase II relationship (1:N). Phase III MCP tools read/write Task records but do not alter the Task schema.

## Backend Endpoint Isolation

| Phase | Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Phase II** | `/api/tasks` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | CRUD operations on tasks (existing, unchanged) |
| **Phase II** | `/api/auth/*` | POST | Authentication endpoints (existing, unchanged) |
| **Phase III** | `/api/{user_id}/chat` | POST | Stateless AI chat endpoint for natural language task management |

> **IMPORTANT:** Phase II endpoints (`/api/tasks`, `/api/auth/*`) must remain unchanged. Phase III introduces only `/api/{user_id}/chat`. The `{user_id}` path parameter is validated against the JWT token claims to prevent unauthorized access.

### Chat Endpoint Contract

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Add a task to buy groceries",
  "conversation_id": "optional-uuid-for-existing-conversation"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "I've added 'Buy groceries' to your tasks!",
  "conversation_id": "uuid-of-conversation"
}
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Deployment & Environment Variables

### Phase III Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Used By |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Neon PostgreSQL connection string | Backend (Hugging Face) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for Agents SDK | Backend (Hugging Face) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_DOMAIN_KEY` | ChatKit domain key | Frontend (Vercel) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Better Auth secret for JWT validation | Backend (Hugging Face) |

### Deployment Targets

| Component | Platform | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **ChatKit Frontend** | Vercel | Integrated into existing Phase II Next.js deployment |
| **Chat Backend** | Hugging Face | Extended Phase II FastAPI with `/api/{user_id}/chat` endpoint |

> **IMPORTANT:** Phase III environment variables must not conflict with Phase II. Use separate `.env` entries and never hardcode secrets.

## Phase III Memory & PHR Guidelines

### Memory Updates for Phase III

After completing Phase III tasks, update `.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` with:

- **AI Agent Patterns:** OpenAI Agents SDK configuration, prompt templates, tool binding patterns
- **MCP Integration:** MCP server setup, tool registration, tool invocation patterns
- **ChatKit Configuration:** Frontend integration approach, domain key setup, component patterns
- **Conversation Management:** History loading strategy, message persistence patterns, conversation lifecycle
- **Stateless Design:** Patterns for reconstructing context from database, concurrency handling

### PHR Routing for Phase III

All Phase III PHRs are routed to: `history/prompts/002-todo-ai-chatbot/`

PHR stages applicable to Phase III:
- `spec` — Feature specification work
- `plan` — Architecture and planning
- `tasks` — Task breakdown
- `green` — Implementation (new features)
- `refactor` — Improvements to Phase III code
- `misc` — Other Phase III work

---

## Phase III Code Standards

**OpenAI Agents SDK:**
- Define tools with clear descriptions for accurate intent classification
- Handle agent errors gracefully; return user-friendly messages
- Do not expose internal tool errors to the user

**MCP Server:**
- All tools must validate `user_id` ownership before operating on tasks
- Tool parameters must be validated via Pydantic models
- Tool results must be JSON-serializable

**ChatKit Frontend:**
- Use the official ChatKit components; do not build custom chat UI
- Handle loading and error states for chat messages
- Display conversation history on page load

**Conversation Persistence:**
- Always persist both user messages and assistant responses
- Store tool invocations (name, args, result) in the Message table for auditability
- Use database transactions when persisting message pairs
